     Each source fills in the fields it knows about. Later sources win, so

     to `stats` below, and anything still missing renders as "—".

    /* Holder count. DexScreener does not report holders, and no single explorer
       is reliable for a token this new — Blockscout was answering 0 for
       $STONKEXSTR, which just means it hasn't indexed the holders yet.

       So the providers below are tried IN ORDER and the first one to return a
       count above zero wins. A zero is treated as "no answer" and falls through
       to the next provider: a launched token with liquidity cannot have none.
       Run the page with ?debug=1 to see which provider answered.

         blockscout     — base.blockscout.com. Free, no key. Was returning 0,
                          then errors, for this token — it has not indexed it.
         geckoterminal  — free, no key. Only has a count for tokens it indexes.
         etherscan      — Etherscan V2 multichain. Needs `etherscanApiKey`, and
                          its tokenholdercount action requires a PAID plan.
         moralis        — needs `moralisApiKey`; the free tier is enough.

       Providers without a key are skipped, so the key-free ones are tried first
       and the rest only engage once you fill a key in.

       ▸ The reliable answer is the indexer in worker/: it counts holders from
         $STONKEXSTR transfer history, so it needs no explorer at all. Once it
         is deployed and synced it supplies `holders` through sources.rewards
         and this whole chain becomes a fallback.

       Set `enabled: false` to stop fetching holders here entirely. */

    /* Rewards figures — total fees collected and total $STONKEX distributed.
       These are project numbers, so they come from the project's own API.

       ▸ SET `url` TO THE JSON ENDPOINT that carries the reward totals.
         Pass one URL or an array of them; each is read through `fields` below
         and the first source to yield a number for a metric wins.

       These thestonks.exchange endpoints have been checked and do NOT carry the
       totals — don't bother pointing at them again:
         /api/kols/airdrops?token=<ca>   KOL airdrops; empty for this token
         /api/fee-routing?pairs=<ca>:<feeLocker>
                                         routing config only — it is what told
                                         us fees route to "rewards" via the
                                         index contract recorded above
         /api/coins                      token metadata + supply, no totals

       The token page also issues Alchemy JSON-RPC calls, so the figures it
       renders are likely read straight off the rewards-index contract rather
       than served by an API. If so, they need either an endpoint that exposes
       them or an indexer — a browser cannot sum transfer logs over Base history.

       `fields` maps our metric names onto the response. Values are dot-paths,
       so 'data.stats.totalFeesUsd' and 'rewards.0.amount' both work. Several
       common spellings are listed per metric — the first one that resolves to a
       number wins, so you can usually just add yours to the front of the list.

       The endpoint must send permissive CORS headers, since the browser calls
       it directly. If it doesn't, proxy it from your own domain.              */
